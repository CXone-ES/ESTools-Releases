## ‚ûï Creating User Profiles

![create_user](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2702ca46-a1ad-4e8d-a23f-24e8941edff4)

Chrome Profiles and Microsoft SSO extension paths are required in or for this app to work. This will work with your default work profile but if you want to create a new profile/don't have a profile the instructions can be found here: https://support.google.com/chrome/answer/2364824?hl=en&co=GENIE.Platform%3DDesktop

Once you have a profile you would like to use, you will need to know the path to both the profile and the Microsoft SSO extension in order to add a User.

The typical path to the profile is:
- C:\Users\\{Your UserName}\AppData\Local\Google\Chrome\User Data\Default || {Profile #}

For the Microsoft SSO extension:
- C:\Users\\{Your UserName}\AppData\Local\Google\Chrome\User Data\{Profile #}\Extensions\ppnbnpeolgkicgegkbkbjmhlideopiji\1.0.##_#
- To ensure its the correct extension look inside the 1.0.##_# folder you should see multiple windows PNGs and a manifest.json (required)

With a profile and the locations of the two folder you will be ready to create a User by pressing the Add User button and completing the form.

Profile data is stored locally on your machine at:
- C:\Users\\{Your UserName}\AppData\Roaming\estools\config.json
